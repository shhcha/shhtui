## About

SHHTUI is my first major project, intended as a learning project to practice computational methods and improve my personal abilities
This project exists mainly because I thought it would be an okay project to continue my programming journey and creating an open-source library that others can use is my preferred way to have new projects started
Currently, this project is fully C++, although as time progresses alternative languages might be used to have better community support

Goals:
- [ ] Necessary widget options
- [ ] Debug Logging system
- [ ] Streamline API

Language/Framework: C++
Platform(s): Linux, macOS*
Status: Alpha / Beta / Stable

\* _Untested platform, but should work_

## Features

Current features include :

    - Widget by Widget focusing and key processing
    - Q to Quit


\* _Working, under development_
